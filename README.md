# Home Office sketch kit

This kit contains components and patterns from the Home Office Design System. The [Home Office system](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns) extends the GOV.UK system with patterns, components and styles for additional use cases and users.

## How to use

All the components and patterns are saved as symbols. Symbols in Sketch are its way of reusing common elements. Symbols allow you to drop an element into a design without needing to create it from scratch. To insert a symbol, choose the 'insert' button, and then select the symbol you need.

To modify text on the symbol without overwriting the default elements, type in the overrides in the right-hand side panel.
