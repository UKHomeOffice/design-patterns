# How to use

All the components and patterns are saved as symbols. Symbols are Sketch's way of importing an element that has already been created. It allows you to simply drop in an element without needing to build them yourself every time. To insert a symbol into your wireframe, choose the 'insert' button, and then hover over 'symbol'. This will show a list of desktop symbols that are available to import. 

To modify text on the symbol without overwriting the default elements, type in the overrides in the right hand side.
