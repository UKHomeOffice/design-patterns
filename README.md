# Home Office design system

The [Design System](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns) for Home Office Digital, Data and Technology extends the GOV.UK system with patterns, components and styles for additional use cases and users.

This kit contains components and patterns from the Design System.

# How to use

All the components and patterns are saved as symbols. Symbols in Sketch are its way of reusing common elements. Symbol allows you to drop an element into a design without needing to create it from scratch. To insert a symbol into your wireframe, choose the 'insert' button, and then hover over 'symbol'. This will show a list of desktop symbols that are available to import.

To modify text on the symbol without overwriting the default elements, type in the overrides in the right hand side.
